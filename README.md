# ALOHA 
An IoT hub for the raspberry pi

## TODOS
- [-] verify ssl is disabled for https requests - security vulnerability
- [-] make monitoring functions more generic
- [-] look into parellel processing for monitoring of services/ssdp vs http
- [-] build a gui or expose an API - should contain configurations for groups/scenes based on events, as well as timeout behavior
- [-] add license
